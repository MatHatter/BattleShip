# BattleShip
BattleShip Game In VBA

Player 1 and player 2 should start by placing their battleships in the "Player1SetUp" worksheet and the "Player2SetUp" worksheet, respectfully.

Each player should select a cell and drag horizontally to vertically 5 cells to place their Air Craft Carrier. Repeat these steps but with 4 cells for each player's Battleship, 3 for the Cruiser, 3 for the Submarine, and 2 for the Destroyer.

After "pieces are placed", each player should launch missiles at each other one by one in the Player1Sheet and Player2Sheet.

The first player to sink all their opponents ships wins.

Missiles can be launched via the launch missiles button or the on the form.

The score is tallied on the form so that if the players decide to end before all ships have been sunk, the player with the higher score would win.

Enjoy
